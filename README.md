# Maze Solver using Backtracking üèÅ

## Overview
This project implements a *maze solver* using the *Backtracking algorithm* in *C++. The program takes a 2D grid representing the maze and finds a path from the **start (top-left corner)* to the *end (bottom-right corner)*.

## How It Works
- The maze is represented as a *2D array*, where:
  - 1 = Open path (can move).
  - 0 = Wall (cannot pass).
- The algorithm explores all possible paths recursively.
- If a valid path exists, it prints the solution.
